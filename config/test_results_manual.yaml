# Each project has rocm/cuda sections with:
#   workflow_name: human-readable CI name
#   run_url: link to the CI run
#   run_date: ISO 8601 date of the run
#   conclusion: overall run conclusion (success/failure)
#   summary:
#     total_jobs: number of test jobs
#     passed: number that passed
#     failed: number that failed
#     skipped: number skipped
#     pass_rate: float percentage (e.g. 95.0)
